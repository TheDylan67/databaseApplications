-- 1. Using an INNER JOIN, count how many players have stats for the
--    2025-26 season.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS matched
FROM   players p
JOIN   player_season_stats s
       ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26';


-- 2. Using a LEFT JOIN from players, count how many rows you get for
--    the same thing.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS matched
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_season_stats s
  ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26';

-- 3. List the names of players who have no 2025-26 season stats.
SELECT p.full_name
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_season_stats s
  ON s.player_id = p.player_id AND s.season = '2025-26'
WHERE s.player_id IS NULL;


-- 4. In movies_small.db, count how many rows in roles have no
--    character name recorded.

SELECT COUNT(*) as roles_without_character
FROM roles
WHERE character_name IS NULL;


-- 5. Show ten people from movies_small.db who have no birth year
--    recorded.
SELECT * 
FROM people
WHERE birth_year IS NULL
LIMIT 10;
-- 6. Pick any query from this unit you found interesting, run it, and
--    export the results to CSV. Name the file
--    unit2_report_lastname.csv and commit it alongside this file.

SELECT tgs.game_date, t.team_name, tgs.points
FROM team_game_stats tgs
JOIN teams t ON tgs.team_id = t.team_id
LIMIT 20;

-- Queries 1 and 2 return different numbers. What are they, and what
-- does the difference represent?


-- In query 3 you filtered with IS NULL. Which table did that NULL
-- come from, and why is it NULL?
