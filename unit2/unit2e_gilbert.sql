-- 1. How many teams are in each state?
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM teams
GROUP BY state
HAVING count(*) > 1;
-- 2. Same as query 1, but sorted with the most teams first.
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM teams
GROUP BY state
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY team_count DESC;

-- 3. Same as query 2, but only show states with more than one team.
SELECT state, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM teams
GROUP BY state
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY team_count DESC;

-- 4. For each season, show the average points scored per game,
--    rounded to one decimal.
SELECT season, ROUND(AVG(pts), 1) AS avg_points
FROM team_game_stats
GROUP BY season;

-- 5. For each team, count how many games they won. (Wins are
--    wl = 'W'.) Show team_id and the win count.

SELECT team_id, COUNT(*) AS win_count
FROM team_game_stats
WHERE wl = 'W'
GROUP BY team_id;

-- 6. Same as query 5, but only teams with more than 200 wins.
SELECT team_id, COUNT(*) AS win_count
FROM team_game_stats
WHERE wl = 'W'
GROUP BY team_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 200;

-- Which two states have the most teams, and how many each?


-- In query 6 you used both WHERE and HAVING. Explain in your own
-- words what each one filtered.
